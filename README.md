## Energy efficiency of code generated by LLM's

This repo contains an experiment measuring and comparing the energy efficiency of code generated by different SOTA LLM's.


It uses experiment runner (TODO: ref to repo) and energieconfig () to measure the variables.

Three algorithms were compared, the Branch and Bound (BB), Bellman Ford (BFA) and the Smith-Waterman algorithms (SWA). The code snippets, along with the

To use energy config you need to have cargo installed.

You can install cargo by

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
and then add the following to your configuration file

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

The binaries read from input files in the parent directory, which are generated from gen.py, the parameters there were selected for the experiments, if you want to change them you can run

```bash
python3 gen.py
```

within each directory
